So, you may have been spending the past several months cursing my name (looking
at you, Steve) thinking I was just some cheap bastard since I didn't get you a 
bachelor party gift. While that analysis partially holds up, I still did go 
through with getting you a token of appreciation for standing up with me in August.

Since we are all from the same general era, I figured we all have nostalgia for
old NES, Genesis, and SNES games, so I figured I would try to provide something
that would allow all of us to re-live those glory years. 
So in the package I sent you there should be three main items:

1. A computer board enclosed in a case that looks like a miniature Nintendo.
1. Two controllers that can be plugged into aforementioned board via USB.
1. A micro-USB power adapter...for power.

I'm sure you're all more than able to figure out how to set this stuff up, but
at the risk of that not being true, I am writing this so I don't have to be
on-call with any issues that may arise. That's correct, the only reason I am
writing this is for my own benefit. That should not be of any surprise.
